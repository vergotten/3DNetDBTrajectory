## NeuralNet3DObjectTrajectory

## Description
This project aims to address the problem of object recognition, classification, annotation, and trajectory prediction based on images, including those obtained by 3D scanning systems. The solution involves creating a knowledge base that combines neural network solutions, a virtual prototyping system for creating physically correct images and depth maps of scenes, and automatic labeling tools for synthesized data. The project leverages various Python clients, Docker for containerization, Airflow for workflow management, and Kubernetes for orchestration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Python
- Airflow
- Database Management Libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the Docker image
3. Deploy the application on Kubernetes

## Usage
After successfully installing and setting up the project, you can start using it as follows:

1. **Data Input**: Input your 3D scanning data or images into the system. The data should be in the format that the system expects.

2. **Data Processing**: The system will process the input data, performing tasks such as object recognition, classification, and annotation. For moving objects, the system will also predict their trajectory.

3. **Database Management**: The system uses Python database management libraries, such as SQLAlchemy, to store and manage the processed data. This allows for efficient querying and retrieval of data.

4. **View Results**: You can view the results of the data processing tasks. The results will be presented in a user-friendly format, allowing you to easily understand the recognition, classification, and annotation results, as well as the predicted trajectories of moving objects.

5. **Further Analysis**: If needed, you can perform further analysis on the results using the tools provided by the system.
